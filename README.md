# Matrix Multiplication Using Strassen Algorithm

> You are to develop 2 programs, capable of executing on multiple cores, that can multiply 2 large dense matrices. The 1st program is a multi-threaded Java program. The 2nd program is an OpenMP program. Both programs should be efficient and not adopt a naive approach.
