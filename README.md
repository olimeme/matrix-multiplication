# Matrix Multiplication Using Strassen Algorithm

> This repository contains an implementation of Multithreaded Java implementation of Strassen Algorithm for matrix multiplication. This project was an assignment from CA670 Concurrent Programming course.

You are to develop 2 programs, capable of executing on multiple cores, that can multiply 2 large dense matrices. The 1st program is a multi-threaded Java program. The 2nd program is an OpenMP program. Both programs should be efficient and not adopt a naive approach.
